## Note about the development

- I restart the project based on the required functions and steps. Let start from the begin of the app.
- 
- The others are copied from existing codes. We will upgrade them once ready.


## Note about the csv for database
- Use "Table Tool" to create and edit the csv files. Set the seperator with ";", without header to export.
- The csv exported from Numbers are comma as the seperator. Therefore prevent "," in the value. Which is not good.
